Hello everyone! My name is Adil. Today I will describe my chat bot Telegram. Here is a link for bot https://t.me/Adil154bot

This bot can say hello to you. Just write: Hello there, hello or привет.

If you write command /reg, bot will ask about your name, surname and age.

In the end, the bot will ask if you entered your data correctly. If you choose 'yeah boyyy', bot will write 'Okay, nice to meet you. I will not forget you.'
